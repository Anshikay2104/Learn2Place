                Our aim is to build a learning-first platform that connects
                students with alumni insights and practical resources. The
                project focuses on creating hands-on learning opportunities
                while providing a useful product for students preparing for
                interviews and early-career roles.

                We emphasize mentorship, shared experiences, and curated
                resources so users can discover real-world hiring patterns,
                understand company expectations, and improve their
                readiness for the job market.
