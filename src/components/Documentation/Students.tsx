                We are a team of three students passionate about helping our peers succeed 
                in their placement journey. Having gone through the same confusion and 
                uncertainty, we decided to create a space where students can learn directly 
                from alumni experiences — without searching endlessly or relying on 
                incomplete information.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base">
                Our mission is simple: 
                <strong> to make placement preparation transparent, collaborative, and 
                accessible for all students.</strong>
