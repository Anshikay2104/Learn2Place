            <p className="text-base mb-4">
                Learn2Place is a student-driven initiative created to address a challenge 
                many of us faced during placement preparation: the lack of organized, 
                reliable, and experience-based information about company recruitment 
                processes.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base">
                Every year, seniors graduate, memories fade, and valuable insights about 
                interviews get lost. We wanted to break this cycle and build a platform 
                where knowledge remains accessible — empowering every student with 
                clear guidance, shared experiences, and lasting resources for their 
                placement journey.
